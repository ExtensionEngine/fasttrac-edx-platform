                <ol type="i">
                    <li>these Terms constitute an agreement “signed by you” under any applicable law;</li><br>
                    <li>any notices or other communication regarding your use of the Site may be provided to you electronically (by posting on the Site, by email, and other electronic formats) and will be considered received upon posting or other distribution, but KFT reserves the right to provide communications in paper format.</li>

                <br>
                You consent to the use of the English language in these Terms and all documents or notices relating to them and your use of the Site. You may not assign these Terms or any of your obligations under them without KFT’s prior written consent and any attempted assignment is null and void.  KFT may assign these Terms and any of its obligations under them at any time for any reason.  You and KFT are independent contractors and these Terms may not be used to construe a joint venture, employee, partnership, agency or similar relationship between you and KFT.  If any of these Terms is determined to be unenforceable for any reason, then the unenforceable provision will be deemed amended in a manner that will most nearly carry out the intent of the provision to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law or deleted if amendment is not possible, and the remaining Terms will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. KFT’s failure to enforce these Terms in every instance in which they might apply is not a waiver of any of KFT’s rights, and KFT reserves its right to take all legal steps available to enforce these Terms.  If KFT is unable to perform its services or any of its obligations due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including computer, telecommunications or other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, shortage of labor or materials, civil disturbances, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorist acts, governmental actions, non-performance of third parties or similar reasons, then KFT’s performance will be excused and the time for performance will be extended until a reasonable time following the end of the event of force majeure.  The word “including” as used in these Terms means “including, without being limited to.”  Paragraphs 2, 3, 10, 14 & 15 (and any other sections that by their intent should survive) will survive any termination of your Account, your Use of the Site, or these Terms.

            As is true of most Web sites, our Site gathers certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, on-site bookmarks, on-site subscriptions, clickstream data and site navigation history.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather information about our user base as a whole.  KFT may collect this non-personal information even if you are not registered on any of the Sites.<br>
            <br>
            We may also link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.  This information is tied to personally identifiable information to provide you with feedback about your experiences on the Sites and to provide you with information that you may find interesting or informative.  KFT may also link this information to a particular individual or combine it with personal information if KFT has determined that it needs to identify a user because of safety or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.  We do not share this automatically-collected data with third parties except those that provide direct services to us to facilitate the upkeep of and services provided through the Sites.

            <b>Cookies</b><br>
            <br>
            To enable us to offer you the best possible experience when you visit KFT’s Sites and to offer continually updated information, we assign you a unique identification number stored in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers whenever you interact and browse a KFT Site.<br>
            <br>
            The cookies automatically gather certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to KFT’s Sites and areas visited on the Sites. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of our Sites, so we can improve our Sites to ensure that they are appealing to as many people as possible.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            <b>E-mail Tracking</b><br>
            <br>
            When you sign up to receive information or mailings from KFT Sites, we use clear gifs, web beacons or other such e-mail tracking devices to measure the activity of the e-mail, including your clicking on a link within an e-mail and your forwarding of the e-mail.  This information is tied to your e-mail address when stored.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            <b>Information Use, Sharing and Disclosure</b><br>
            <br>
            Except as set forth below, KFT does not rent, sell, or share any personal information about individual users with any third party except (i) to operate the Sites, (ii) to provide the products or services you’ve requested, and (iii) to send you information consistent with our charitable purpose.  KFT may use the information described above including any of your personal information collected by KFT for (1) its internal purposes, including to contact you about the Sites, a KFT Course, or the services offered through the Sites or a KFT Affiliate, (2) to facilitate services offered through the Sites, KFT Affiliates and programs of KFT, (3) to contact you about KFT's program activities, (4)  for other purposes you opt in to accept, and (5) for research purposes, provided any research results will be published in an anonymous form.<br>
            <br>
            In addition, KFT may provide your information to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation (“EMKF”), which is a 501(c)(3) charitable enterprise.  EMKF will use the information only as KFT is permitted to use it under the terms of this Privacy Policy, including agreeing not to sell any information for marketing or any other purposes.<br>
            <br>
            We occasionally hire other companies and individuals to provide services on our behalf, including packaging and mailing, answering customer questions about products or services, sending and tracking postal mail or email, processing data and conducting research.  We will only provide those companies and individuals the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
            <br>
            The information you provide to KFT is also used to better understand the content needs of registrants to our Sites and participants in KFT programs. Our goal in collecting personal information and monitoring visitor traffic patterns through use of cookies, log files, and e-mail tracking is to provide you with the best available Web experience for online information.<br>
            <br>
            KFT reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, to defend KFT or EMKF against legal claims, or if KFT determines it is necessary to investigate or take action in connection with activities that KFT suspects are illegal, threaten the safety of any person or are in violation of these Terms.

        <p>
            <b>Credit Card Information</b><br>
            <br>
            If you choose to purchase products or pay for event registrations on KFT’s Sites, you may need to provide personal information and authorization to charge an expense to a specified credit card.  KFT will only use third party processing companies who operate in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) to process such transactions and KFT will not receive or have direct access to any information associated with the credit card including the credit card number.   For example, in addition to the information above, you may need to provide a mailing address, billing address, credit card number and telephone number.  KFT will, thus, not use the credit card information and the third party entity will be permitted to store and use the credit card only to process the transaction and only as permitted by PCI DSS.
        </p><br><br>

            By using our Sites, you consent to the collection and use of information by KFT as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page so that you always have the opportunity to be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.  Your use of the Site after the posting of the amendment notice will constitute your agreement with the amended Privacy Policy.
