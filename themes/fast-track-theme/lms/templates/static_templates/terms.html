            <h3>II. Privacy Policy</h3>

The following statements will help you understand how KFT collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you provide to us on our Sites.</p>
            <p>Please note that this policy applies only to KFT’s Sites and not to any other organizations' Web sites to which we link. Remember that when you use a link to go from a KFT Site to another Web site, KFT’s Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites KFT links to, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read those rules and policies before proceeding. KFT does not make any representations about the practices and policies of any organization or Web site we link to and disclaims any liability or responsibility for such other Web site’s content, rules, policies or otherwise.</p>

            <h3>Types of information we collect</h3>
            <p>The types of information that may be collected on any of KFT’s Sites include: (1) personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis (voluntary registration),(2) information about you and/or a business venture that you may provide to KFT in the course of participating in a KFT program ; (3) Site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our sites; and (4) e-mail tracking information.   In some instances KFT may also append data about you that it collects from the Site with other data that KFT may receive from you or third party sources.  Regardless of the data collected or the source of such data, any information KFT maintains about you will be used only as permitted by this Privacy Policy.  The information types referenced above may be collectively referred to here as the “Data” hereafter.</p>

            <h3>Voluntary Registration</h3>

When registering, visitors may be asked to provide their name, email address, telephone number, work address and other pertinent information.

            <h3>Program Information</h3>
            <p>In the course of requesting to participate in or actually participating in an educational program that utilizes content developed, owned or licensed by KFT (a “KFT Course”), you may knowingly and voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information about you or a business venture in which you are participating.  You may disclose such information electronically through submissions of information to a Site or by submitting information to a separate entity that delivers a KFT Course to you (a “KFT Affiliate”).  A KFT Affiliate may be under an obligation to provide certain data regarding your participation in the KFT Course to KFT and KFT may need to disclose certain information to a KFT Affiliate in order for you to be registered in or participate in the KFT Course.</p>

            <h3>Log Files</h3>
            <p>As is true of most Web sites, our Sites gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, on-site bookmarks, on-site subscriptions, clickstream data and site navigation history.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather information about our user base as a whole.  KFT may collect this non-personal information even if you are not registered on any of the Sites.</p>
            <p>We may also link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.  This information is tied to personally identifiable information to provide you with feedback about your experiences on the Sites and to provide you with information that you may find interesting or informative.  KFT may also link this information to a particular individual or combine it with personal information if KFT has determined that it needs to identify a user because of safety or security issues or to comply with legal requirements.  We do not share this automatically-collected data with third parties except those that provide direct services to us to facilitate the upkeep of and services provided through the Sites.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>To enable us to offer you the best possible experience when you visit KFT’s Sites and to offer continually updated information, we assign you a unique identification number stored in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers whenever you interact and browse a KFT Site.</p>
            <p>The cookies automatically gather certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to KFT’s Sites and areas visited on the Sites. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of our Sites, so we can improve our Sites to ensure that they are appealing to as many people as possible.</p>

            <h3>E-mail Tracking</h3>
            <p>When you sign up to receive information or mailings from KFT Sites, we use clear gifs, web beacons or other such e-mail tracking devices to measure the activity of the e-mail, including your clicking on a link within an e-mail and your forwarding of the e-mail.  This information is tied to your e-mail address when stored.</p>

            <h3>Other Data</h3>
            <p>In some instances, KFT may be able to combine the information you provide to the Foundation via the Site with other information that the Foundation has collected from you or from third parties so that the Foundation may develop a profile of you that facilitates the presentation of content via the Site that may be of the most interest to you.  </p>

            <h3>Information Use, Sharing and Disclosure </h3>
            <p>The information you provide to KFT is also used to better understand the content needs of registrants to our Sites and participants in KFT programs. Our goal in collecting personal information and monitoring visitor traffic patterns through use of cookies, log files, and e-mail tracking is to provide you with the best available Web experience for online information.  In this spirit, KFT may use the information described above including any of your personal information collected by KFT for (1) its internal purposes, including to contact you about the Sites, a KFT Course, or the services offered through the Sites or a KFT Affiliate, (3) to optimize your site usage experience and present you with information that KFT believes will be relevance and/or interest to you based on the Data (3) to facilitate services offered through the Sites, KFT Affiliates and programs of KFT (including addressing any customer service issues you may have reported to KFT), (4) to contact you about KFT's program activities, (5)  for other purposes you opt in to accept or for which you have specifically consented.  </p>
            <p>If you apply or register for a FastTrac® course that is delivered by a KFT Affiliate, we will provide your personal information, including any demographic information you have provided to us, to the KFT Affiliate providing the FastTrac® course and the course instructors, who have permission to use it only to facilitate your participation in the course, to contact you after the course for follow-up related to the course, and for other purposes you opt in to accept.</p>
            <p>KFT may share the Data with its organizations affiliated with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation (all of which are 501(c)(3) organizations), provided the affiliates use the Data consistent with this privacy policy and solely for charitable purposes.  KFT does not rent, sell, or share any personal information about individual users with any third party except to accomplish the above purposes.</p>
            <p>We occasionally retain contractors to provide services on our behalf, including packaging and mailing, answering customer questions about products or services (including responding to customer service issues you may report to the Foundation any inquiries you may make), sending and tracking postal mail or email, processing data and accessing your account for customer service purposes to address and evaluate issues you have reported.  We will only provide those contractors the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purposes.</p>
            <p>In some instances, KFT may desire to transfer some elements of the Data to third party researchers in order to conduct research that advances KFT’s charitable mission.  The Foundation will only transfer personal information that would enable a researcher to connect such information with you personally if KFT has first obtained your specific consent to transfer the information for that purpose.  If you provide KFT with such consent, KFT may transfer your personal information to the identified third party researcher for the consented to research.  Without your consent, KFT may provide the Data or specific elements of it to third parties to conduct research consistent with KFT’s charitable purpose provided that any information transferred is aggregated and anonymized such that a researcher would not be able to determine that such information was provided by you personally.</p>
            <p>KFT reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process, to defend KFT against legal claims, or if KFT determines it is necessary to investigate or take action in connection with activities that KFT suspects are illegal, threaten the safety of any person or are in violation of these Terms.</p>
            <p>In addition, we may sell all or parts of our organization or assets.  In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets and may be disclosed in connection with negotiations relating to a proposed transaction.  In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of KFT's organization, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.  In such case, the transferred information may become subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Your Consent</h3>
            <p>By using our Sites, you consent to the collection and use of information by KFT as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this page so that you always have the opportunity to be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>

            <p>These Terms and the resolution of any dispute related to these Terms or the Sites shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Missouri applicable to contracts executed and performed within Missouri, without giving any effect to any conflict of laws rules that may result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  These Terms are deemed executed and enforceable in the State of Missouri.</p>

            <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>If a dispute arises between you and KFT, each party irrevocably agrees to (i) resolve the dispute through binding arbitration conducted in Kansas City, Missouri in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), (ii) bring any dispute to enforce arbitration under these Terms or to pursue injunctive relief exclusively in the federal and state courts located in Jackson County, Missouri, United States of America and (iii) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objection to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts based on forum non conveniens or other grounds.  Each party will be responsible for its expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators' and administrative fees of arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to seek temporary injunctive relief if it determines it is necessary in order to prevent irreparable harm (including infringement of any intellectual property).  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Sites or these terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>

            <h3>VII.  General Provisions</h3>
            <h3>Assignment </h3>
            <p>You may not assign these Terms or any of your obligations under them without KFT’s prior written consent and any attempted assignment is null and void.  KFT may assign these Terms and any of its obligations under them at any time for any reason.</p>

            <h3>Electronic Communications; Binding and Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>You agree that (i) these Terms constitute an agreement “signed by you” under any applicable law; and (ii) any notices or other communication regarding your use of the Sites may be provided to you electronically (by posting on the Sites, by email, and other electronic formats) and will be considered received upon posting or other distribution. These Terms (including the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement between you and KFT and supersede all other agreements, oral or written, concerning its subject matter.  You consent to the use of the English language in these Terms and all documents or notices relating to them and your use of the Sites.    </p>

            <h3>Severability </h3>
            <p>If any of these Terms is determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable for any reason, then the unenforceable provision will be deemed amended in a manner that will most nearly carry out the intent of the provision to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law or deleted if amendment is not possible, and the remaining Terms will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

            <h3>No Waiver  </h3>
            <p>KFT’s failure to enforce these Terms in every instance in which they might apply is not a waiver of any of KFT’s rights, and KFT reserves its right to take all legal steps available to enforce these Terms.</p>
